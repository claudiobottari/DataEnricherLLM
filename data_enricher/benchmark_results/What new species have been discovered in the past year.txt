--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
There have been several new species discovered in the past year across various taxonomic groups. Here are a few notable examples:

1. Oculudentavis khaungraae: This tiny bird-like dinosaur was discovered preserved in amber from Myanmar. It was initially thought to be the smallest known dinosaur, but its classification is still debated.

[https://www.worldwildlife.org/stories/380-new-species-discovered-in-the-greater-mekong-in-2021-and-2022]
In the past year, 380 new species have been discovered in the Greater Mekong region of Southeast Asia, including Cambodia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand, and Vietnam. These new species include a color-changing lizard, a thick-thumbed bat, a venomous snake named after a Chinese mythological goddess, an orchid that resembles a Muppet, and a tree frog with moss-like skin. The discoveries were made by hundreds of scientists from universities, conservation organizations, and research institutes. The new species include 290 plants, 19 fishes, 24 amphibians, 46 reptiles, and one mammal. This brings the total number of described species in the Greater Mekong region since 1997 to 3,389. However, many of these species are already under threat of extinction due to human activities, and WWF is calling on governments in the region to increase protection for these rare creatures and their habitats. WWF works with various partners to protect flagship species and their habitats, and to address issues such as wildlife trafficking and illegal wildlife markets.
