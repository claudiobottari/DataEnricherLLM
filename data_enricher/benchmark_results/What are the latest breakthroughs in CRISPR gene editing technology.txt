The latest breakthroughs in CRISPR gene editing technology include the development of base editors, prime editors, and CRISPR-associated transposon (CAST) systems. Base editors, such as cytosine base editors (CBE) and adenine base editors (ABE), can make precise base substitutions without requiring double-stranded DNA breaks (DSBs) or donor DNA templates. These base editors have been improved to expand their genome-targeting range and increase their efficiency. Programmable C-to-G base editors (CGBEs) have also been developed to achieve targeted C-to-G and G-to-C base transversions. However, base editors have off-target effects that need to be reduced for clinical applications.

Prime editing (PE) is a newly developed technology that enables all types of base conversion, small deletions, and insertions. PE consists of a prime editor protein and prime editing gRNA (pegRNA). The PE protein is constructed by fusing an engineered Cas9 nickase with reverse transcriptase, which can be targeted to the genomic locus by pegRNA. PE is more versatile and precise compared to base editing, and various optimized versions of PE have been developed to improve editing efficiency.

CRISPR-associated transposon (CAST) systems facilitate the RNA-guided transposition of mobile genetic elements, allowing for targeted, precise, and efficient insertion of large DNA segments. Different types of CAST systems, such as type I-F and type V-K, have been successfully reconstituted to achieve the integration of donor DNA into specific bacterial genome sites. The FiCAT system, which combines a SpCas9 protein with an engineered piggyBac (PB) transposase, has been developed for targeted integration of multi-kilobase DNA fragments into mammalian cell genomes.

In terms of delivery systems for CRISPRs, various methods have been established for ex vivo delivery of genome editing reagents, while adeno-associated virus (AAV) has been used for in vivo delivery. However, AAV-based delivery has limitations, such as off-target editing and viral vector integration. Alternative strategies, such as lipid nanoparticles (LNP) and virus-like particle (VLP) systems, are being explored for safer and more efficient in vivo delivery of genome editors.

In the field of cardiovascular disease (CVD) research, CRISPR-Cas systems have been used for modeling and treating CVD. In vitro models using human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs) differentiated into cardiomyocytes have been created through genome editing to study the role of specific genes or mutations in cardiomyopathies. Various gene editing tools, including CRISPR-Cas9, base editors, and prime editors, have been applied to create CVD models in vitro and in vivo. AAV-based delivery systems are commonly used for delivering CRISPR-Cas components to the cardiovascular system.
