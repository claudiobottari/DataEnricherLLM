Augmented reality (AR) technology is being used in modern classrooms to enhance learning retention and critical thinking, particularly in the context of the science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics (STEAM) program. The use of AR technology in education aims to create a knowledge-building environment by combining virtual and actual environments. AR allows for the interaction between real and virtual objects, providing a more engaging and interactive learning experience. It can be used to display digital content such as images, videos, and forms, promoting deeper and more effective learning. AR technology can be used directly or indirectly in the teaching and learning environment to assist and sustain learners in dealing with knowledge and interacting with it. It has the potential to improve students' learning outcomes, foster a variety of thought processes, and revitalize the educational system. AR is particularly beneficial for activity-centered STEAM education, as it strengthens learner-centered activities and helps students develop scientific knowledge and understanding. However, implementing AR in STEM education can be challenging due to the usability of AR devices and technological issues with AR applications.

Augmented reality (AR) technologies are being used in modern classrooms to improve student learning and critical thinking skills. However, there are some constraints and challenges associated with the use of AR apps, such as limited scaffolding of the learning process, inadequate model quality, low simulation accuracy, and insufficient haptic feedback. Additionally, many free AR authoring tools are not user-friendly, and instructors lack access to AR instructional content. Despite these challenges, AR can significantly enhance comprehension, memory, and knowledge transfer by engaging students and encouraging them to take an active role in their learning.

AR is particularly effective in promoting critical thinking (CT) skills and problem-solving abilities. CT skills include argument analysis, inductive/deductive inference, assessment/evaluation, and problem-solving or decision-making. By incorporating AR into instruction, students can develop higher-order thinking skills, collaborate with peers, and engage in project-based learning. Studies have shown that the integration of AR and STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Arts, and Mathematics) education can improve students' CT skills and develop 21st-century skills.

AR technology also has a positive impact on learning retention. Students who learn through AR demonstrate higher test scores and retention rates compared to traditional teaching methods. However, it is important to note that AR primarily enhances short-term memory, and its impact on long-term memory is still uncertain. To maximize the benefits of AR, it is crucial to ensure that the system meets the emotional and cognitive demands of the users, motivating them to engage deeply with the content.

In research studies, a quasi-experimental pretest/posttest control group design is commonly used to assess the effectiveness of AR in teaching. The design involves randomly assigning groups of students to experimental and control groups, with the experimental group using AR applications for instruction while the control group uses conventional methods. The results of these studies have shown that AR significantly improves learning outcomes and CT skills.

Overall, AR technology in modern classrooms offers a promising approach to enhance student learning, engagement, and critical thinking skills. By providing interactive and immersive learning experiences, AR can deepen students' understanding of complex concepts and promote active participation in the learning process.
