What's the current status of international efforts to combat climate change?

---------------------------------------------
The current status of international efforts to combat climate change can be summarized as follows:

1. Paris Agreement: The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, is a landmark international treaty aimed at limiting global warming to well below 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels. As of now, 197 countries have ratified the agreement, including major emitters like the United States, China, and the European Union.

2. Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs): Under the Paris Agreement, countries submit their own voluntary climate action plans known as NDCs. These plans outline the steps each country will take to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and adapt to climate change. Many countries have updated their NDCs to enhance their climate targets, while some are still in the process of doing so.

3. COP26: The 26th UN Climate Change Conference of the Parties (COP26) was scheduled to take place in 2020 but was postponed to November 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. COP26 is expected to be a crucial event where countries will assess progress, negotiate further actions, and discuss financial support for developing nations.

4. Global Climate Action: Various global initiatives and alliances have emerged to accelerate climate action. These include the Global Climate Action Agenda, the Race to Zero campaign, and the Climate Ambition Alliance. These initiatives aim to mobilize non-state actors, such as cities, businesses, and civil society, to contribute to emissions reductions and sustainable development.

5. Financial Support: Developed countries committed to mobilizing $100 billion per year by 2020 to support climate action in developing nations. However, this target has not been fully met, and discussions continue on how to enhance climate finance and support vulnerable countries in adapting to climate impacts.

6. Challenges and Gaps: Despite progress, there are challenges and gaps in international efforts. Some countries have not yet ratified the Paris Agreement, and there is a need for increased ambition in emission reduction targets. Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic has diverted attention and resources away from climate action, making it crucial to ensure a green recovery.

Overall, while international efforts to combat climate change have gained momentum, there is still a need for stronger commitments, increased financial support, and enhanced collaboration to effectively address the global climate crisis.

1. The World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) was established in 1980 to advance climate science and numerical simulation of atmospheric and oceanic phenomena.

2. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) was created in 1988 by the United Nations to share scientific knowledge and provide up-to-date reports on climate change.

3. The Rio Earth Summit in 1992 marked the beginning of global efforts to combat climate change, with the signing of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) by 166 countries.

4. The Kyoto Protocol, adopted in 1997, aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 5.2% compared to 1990 levels. It came into effect in 2005.

5. The European Union launched the European Union Emissions Trading System in 2005, allowing companies to trade emission allowances to reduce carbon emissions.

6. The Copenhagen Climate Change Conference in 2009 defined the maximum acceptable increase in global temperature as 2°C above pre-industrial levels, but failed to reach a binding agreement on emissions reduction targets.

7. The Cancun Climate Change Conference in 2010 established the Green Climate Fund to support developing countries in combating climate change and deforestation.

8. The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015, set the goal of limiting global warming to "well below" 2°C and emphasized the role of developed countries in providing financial support and technology transfers to developing countries.

9. The IPCC published three comprehensive reports in 2018 and 2019, highlighting the consequences of climate change and strengthening the resolve for voluntary measures.

10. The European Green Deal, adopted in 2019, aims for carbon neutrality in the European Union by 2050.

11. China pledged to peak emissions before 2030 and achieve carbon neutrality by 2060, while the United States rejoined international efforts under President Joe Biden in 2021.

Overall, international efforts to combat climate change have evolved over time, with agreements and initiatives focusing on emissions reduction, financial support, and technology transfer to address the global challenge of climate change.

The current status of international efforts to combat climate change includes the following information:

1. Limiting global warming to 1.5degC above pre-industrial temperatures requires reaching net zero CO2 emissions by 2050 in every country, regardless of size.

2. Major emitters like China and India have signed the Paris Agreement and are taking action on climate change. China has committed to reaching carbon neutrality by 2060 and has reduced coal mining capacity. India has set a target to install 175 gigawatts of renewable energy generators by 2022.

3. In the United States, emissions levels have started to decline since 2005, although there was a rise in energy-related carbon dioxide emissions between 2017 and 2018. The decision by President Donald Trump to withdraw from the Paris Agreement was reversed by the Biden Administration.

4. The UK has the opportunity to lead on climate change by taking early action to decrease emissions. This can position the UK to compete and prosper in the growing market for zero-carbon goods and services. The UK has already achieved economic growth while reducing greenhouse gas emissions.

5. Some analysts suggest that the UK should lower its emissions faster than other countries due to its historic responsibility for causing climate change.

Overall, international efforts to combat climate change involve countries taking action to reduce emissions and transition to a zero-carbon future. The UK has the opportunity to lead in this transition and benefit economically from the growing market for zero-carbon goods and services.

[https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/paris-global-climate-change-agreements]
The current status of international efforts to combat climate change is that countries have been engaged in negotiations and have reached several important agreements, including the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement. However, experts argue that these efforts are not sufficient to limit dangerous global warming. The Paris Agreement, in particular, is seen as inadequate to prevent the global average temperature from rising 1.5 degrees Celsius, which would lead to devastating consequences such as heat waves and floods. Countries have set emissions reduction targets, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs), but these pledges are not ambitious enough to prevent catastrophic warming or adapt to its consequences. There is a consensus among the scientific community about the reality of climate change and its causes, although some politicians, particularly in the United States, deny its existence. The consequences of climate change include heat waves, droughts, floods, rising sea levels, ocean acidification, Arctic ice thaw, and species loss. The international community recognizes the need to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees Celsius, but current commitments are insufficient to achieve this goal. There is ongoing debate about which countries are most responsible for climate change and should bear the burden of emissions reductions. The Paris Agreement is seen as a first step, but additional action is needed, and some experts suggest exploring alternative approaches such as sector-specific agreements or the creation of a climate club to incentivize compliance.
